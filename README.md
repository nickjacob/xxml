### `XXML.stringify`

The main point of this library is to provide a `XXML.stringify` that is identical in functionality to `JSON.stringify`; eventually may add a parsing function. For an example use, see `test.html`

### `filesystem.js`

This provides a simplification of the HTML5 filesystem API, a really simple `createFile` function and a corresponding `read` and `write` function for a `FFile` object. Usage in `test.html`.
